Many people want to accomplish their goals and become higher functioning individuals.  A simple way to do this is to use SMART goals.  So, I will create an app that allows people to refine their goals using the SMART goal setting method.


There are 5 parts to SMART goals, so each part will be something I’m teaching.  Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals.


I want to do this because I procrastinated a lot taking this course.  Finally, I started using SMART goals a few weeks ago.  I used a SMART goal to tackle this course, and here I am finishing it!  It’s exciting.
